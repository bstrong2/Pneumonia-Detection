Hello!!

Note that the images are from kaggle, but we have rearranged the different sets of data.
DATASET IS HERE: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GjtXTtHVioquk0OHJzoNspWxxuS9pNbQ?usp=sharing


The Pneumonia Saves 2.0 is where all of the data that is recorded will go.

Task order:

Image Size
Activation Functions
Num of Conv2D
Layers
Kernel Size
Pool Size
Optimizers

If we want to get the BEST BEST BEST model, then we can test out the best image size, 
num of conv2D, and the layers together. This would take quite a long time to test.
I'm not sure if it would have a major impact but it would certainly be worth trying if we want
the best model possible.
